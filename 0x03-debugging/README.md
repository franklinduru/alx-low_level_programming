C - Debugging

0-main.c, main.h -> this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project

1-main.c -> This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

2-largest_number.c, main.h -> Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case

3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h -> Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
